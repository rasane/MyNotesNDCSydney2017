tech debt is part of healthy s/w dev - gordon gecko 


- bad code is not technical debt
- bugs arent tech debt


technical debt is easy to change & well writtent code
corner cutting 




objective measures
- > cyclometric complexity, copy.paste /simian?
 -> sonar?

 trailing indicators
 - rate of delivery as a team (velocity)
 system availability and performance
 changed it here broke it there
 staff turnover/attrition
 morale passino and happiness
 declining level of industry skills & relevance

 don't do a tech debt sprint
 Resist the rewrite


 the problem is that this is a cultural problem not a tech problem

 iterative tech debt removal
 ?
 refactoring - small and macro changes

micro refactorings - do it always
macro refactorings - 1 or 2 at max macro refactoring efforts active at any point in time

rules for refactoring
- dont change any code that isn't convered by tests


feature flags
- 



it happens due to "us" behavioral reasons from the participating - teams - 
laziness, human error, inexperience and skill gaps


-- Refactoring 
- b professional
- a la @robertmartin @unclebob

pair programming
 - pair, mob

single feature in development at 1 time

resist tempatation
 - framework & package accrual
 - a copied design pattern

 - run hackathons


reduce tech debt through steady improvements
